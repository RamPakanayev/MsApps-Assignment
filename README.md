# MsApps Assignment

This project is a full-stack application with a React.js frontend and a Node.js backend. It fetches and displays images from the Pixabay API.

## Client

The client side of the project is a React.js application that uses Redux for state management.
It fetches images from the Pixabay API through the server, and allows users to navigate through pages of images and sort them.

Detailed documentation on how to setup, run, and use the client side can be found in the [Client README](https://github.com/RamPakanayev/MsApps-Assignment/blob/main/client/README.md).

## Server

The server side of the project is a Node.js application that uses Express.js.
It serves as an intermediary between the client and the Pixabay API, and includes features like pagination and sorting.

Detailed documentation on how to setup, run, and use the server side can be found in the [Server README](https://github.com/RamPakanayev/MsApps-Assignment/blob/main/server/README.md).
